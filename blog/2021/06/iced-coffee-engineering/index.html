            <p>Over the past week or so it&rsquo;s been pretty warm here on the Canadian West Coast. That&rsquo;s led me to want to drink a lot more iced coffee than usual. The downside of this being, of course, that take-out coffee is way more expensive than at-home coffee. So it was time to find a home-grown solution to this problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to make the majority of my home-based coffee in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press">french press</a> and that&rsquo;s done a fine job for me of getting my morning coffee with a minimum amount of hassle and an end product that I really enjoy, thanks in part to James Hoffman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8">Ultimate French Press technique</a>. So the obvious question was - how do I get good iced coffee that I enjoy just as much?</p>
<p>After doing some digging around online, it seems like most people are creating a form of coffee concentrate that&rsquo;s significantly stronger than regular coffee, and serving it over ice which dilutes the hot coffee down to a good strength and a nice chilled temperature. That seemed like a good place to start. One of the variables I will be playing with is the brew water : ice cube ratio. The more water you can use to brew the coffee, the better your extraction and flavour should be. But if you don&rsquo;t have enough ice, it won&rsquo;t chill down quickly enough.</p>
<h3 id="my-coffee-goals">My Coffee Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Iced coffee that I enjoy drinking black</li>
<li>Final yield of ~ 1 litre</li>
<li>Repeatable process</li>
<li>Bonus if it&rsquo;s make-ahead friendly</li>
</ul>
<p>The general process I&rsquo;ve followed is to make a double strength (approx) french press and pour it over ice in a mason jar to get the total volume of water (brew water + ice) to the target of Hoffman&rsquo;s method. This should give a coffee that has the brightness and acidity levels of a hot-brewed coffee, but be chilled down to iced coffee temperatures pretty much right after it&rsquo;s been brewed. I also have an ice tray that produces fairly large ice cubes which melt relatively slowly so I should be able to get away with a bit less ice in the long run.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-1">Attempt #1</h3>
<ul>
<li>60g coffee (coarse-medium grind)</li>
<li>550ml brew water</li>
<li>450g ice</li>
<li>9 minute brew time</li>
</ul>
<p>This first attempt was pretty good for a first try. It was weaker than I would have liked but still tasted good and wasn&rsquo;t overly bitter. I finished the entire litre quite happily.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-2">Attempt #2</h3>
<ul>
<li>60g coffee (medium grind)</li>
<li>650ml brew water</li>
<li>350g ice</li>
<li>20 minute brew time</li>
</ul>
<p>This second attempt I made several changes in an effort to get more coffee out of my coffee&hellip; funny enough I omited the most obvious step of just adding more coffee. This batch was definitely less diluted than the first, but had a bit more bitterness and harshness that I didn&rsquo;t love. I attribute some of that to the really long brew time, and possibly the grind, but since my grinder is a bit inconsistent anyway I&rsquo;ll start by modifying the time.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-3">Attempt #3</h3>
<ul>
<li>70g coffee (medium grind)</li>
<li>750ml brew water</li>
<li>300g ice</li>
<li>15 minute brew time</li>
</ul>
<p>This finally has the balance I&rsquo;m looking for. Lots of good coffee flavour and gets down to a drinkable temperature quickly. Because I&rsquo;m making this the night before in most cases, this recipe more or less goes straight into the fridge once it&rsquo;s done. If I wanted to have it served immediately I could re-balance 50-100g of ice.</p>
