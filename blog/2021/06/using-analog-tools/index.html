            <p>For the last four years I&rsquo;ve been a fountain pen user, some might even say an enthusiast. I&rsquo;ve been using very old technology to help me navigate my otherwise very modern and digital world. Why? Because it makes me think&hellip; and it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I never grew up with fountain pens. I understand that there are places in the world today that still tech kids to write with them, and that in many cases those students can&rsquo;t wait to get away from these messy devices and start using something more modern like a ballpoint pen. But in Canada in the early 21st century there aren&rsquo;t very many places a child is going to encounter a fountain pen in their day-to-day life. I certainly never did until I was in my teens and came across some old broken pen (what I now know to be a lever-fill model) at a garage sale. It didn&rsquo;t write, so I left it behind, not realizing at the time just how neat that probably was. But as a kid I did have a love for stationery, and looked forward to back-to-school every year. Not because I&rsquo;m a nerd (I am) who loved school (meh&hellip; sorta), but because it meant back-to-school shopping. I got to buy new stationery stuff.</p>
<p>But how does that help me now? I&rsquo;ve found over the years that taking the time to use a slower method to get the words from my brain to wherever they need to be allows me to be more intentional with what I say. I end up with a better end product. It also engages my brain differently as I&rsquo;m writing. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810/full" title="The Importance of Cursive Handwriting Over Typewriting for Learning in the Classroom: A High-Density EEG Study of 12-Year-Old Children and Young Adults">Some studies</a> have suggested that writing things out by hand, either on paper or a digital tablet, engages a different part of the brain similar to drawing. This wider engagement of the brain is helpful for learning, and potentially longer term brain health.</p>
<p>If you find yourself banging out tons of keystrokes every day, and you think maybe a bit more intentionality could help those keystrokes to be better, try slowing them down a bit. Try taking some handwritten notes on your fancy iPad Pro, or even pick up a pencil and an old school scrap of paper.</p>
