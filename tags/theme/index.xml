        <description>For the past couple of years I&amp;rsquo;ve eschewed the practice of the New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution in favour of broader goals or themes for the year. These have been helpful for me in providing an overall direction or guidepost for me as I work to make incremental improvements or changes throughout the year.
Where I&amp;rsquo;ve been&amp;hellip; The first of these, &amp;ldquo;Year of Less&amp;rdquo;, helped me to de-clutter mentally and physically, as well as direct my efforts towards a few specific projects and tasks.</description>

        <description>Done. It&amp;rsquo;s a word that conjures up finality. Following in the footsteps of 2017&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Year of Less&amp;rdquo; I have christened 2018 my &amp;ldquo;Year of Done&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of resolutions, be they New Year&amp;rsquo;s or otherwise. I do however like the idea of a theme for the year. After some soul-searching, add some cognitive down-time in the month of December, I have decided that &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; will be my theme for 2018.</description>
