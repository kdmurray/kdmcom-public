        <description>It has been about a year since I started my analog journey. It&amp;rsquo;s has had some ups and some downs, but overall the experience has been extremely positive.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with a slightly (drastically?) more analogue lifestyle for the past few months. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;m becoming some kind of anti-tech zealot, just that I think I can find a bit more balance in my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about my adoption of notebooks and paper for my handwritten notes at work, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t talk much about the how.</description>
