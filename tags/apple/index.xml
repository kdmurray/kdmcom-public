        <description>Podcasts have come a long way since people started just recording audio files and posting them to a website. Over the last decade the advent of RSS and mobile technology has provided publishers with the ability to produce text, audio and video content and have that content delivered directly to millions of subscribers around the world.
While many podcast enthusiasts find shows based on recommendations from friends or social media, the most common way to find new podcasts is through a podcast directory, specifically the iTunes podcast directory.</description>

        <description>In a recent conversation with [Knightwise][kw] we were musing that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that it&amp;rsquo;s very long since we were both ragging on Dave to get off Windows and get a Mac. Today we&amp;rsquo;re both seriously entertaining the possibility that our next primary computing device might be running an OS from Redmond. What changed? Has Windows gotten that much better?
Yes. It&amp;rsquo;s undeniably better.
But we&amp;rsquo;re also different.
And Apple is different.</description>
