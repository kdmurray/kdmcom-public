        <description>For several years I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make the switch to Chrome from Firefox, but the lack of a couple of key plugins has held me back. One of these was the way that windowed plugins were handled initially (the popup for LastPass in Chrome was hideous, but that&amp;rsquo;s no longer an issue.)
The bigger issue for me was the lack of a good vertical tabs plugin for Chrome. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried several tabs but none of them seem to work the way I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to with the venerable Tree Style Tabs in Firefox.</description>
