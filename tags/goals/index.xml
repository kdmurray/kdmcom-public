        <description>We&amp;rsquo;re coming up to the end of the year again. I&amp;rsquo;m already starting to see the conversations starting about one of my most hated holiday season traditions: New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions.
Why am I such a grinch about self improvement? Why be opposed to people making a change for the better? I&amp;rsquo;m not, and I&amp;rsquo;m not. It&amp;rsquo;s not the change, or even the resolution itself that I have problems with, it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;New Year&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; bit, and all of the associated issues that come with it.</description>

        <description>Writing software is something I&amp;rsquo;ve loved to do for a very long time. But a little over a decade ago I made some career choices that meant my day-to-day no longer involved the production of code. I became an amateur developer. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve noodled around with things here and there, and have even managed to write some code that I or a small number of other people have used, but I find it hard to prioritize the time to do these things.</description>

      <title>Year of Done</title>

        <description>Done. It&amp;rsquo;s a word that conjures up finality. Following in the footsteps of 2017&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Year of Less&amp;rdquo; I have christened 2018 my &amp;ldquo;Year of Done&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of resolutions, be they New Year&amp;rsquo;s or otherwise. I do however like the idea of a theme for the year. After some soul-searching, add some cognitive down-time in the month of December, I have decided that &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; will be my theme for 2018.</description>
