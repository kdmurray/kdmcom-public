        <description>For several years I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make the switch to Chrome from Firefox, but the lack of a couple of key plugins has held me back.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get this book read for about the last 18 months. It had come highly recommended by a friend who found the book to be a good look into the technological overload of our modern times, and the inherent constant connectivity to the crowds provided by the Internet.
It took me quite a while to get into this book. Powers&#39; continual assertion that the technology that we have come to rely on is disconnecting us from ourselves, and our reality.</description>
