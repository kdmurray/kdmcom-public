        <description>For the last four years I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fountain pen user, some might even say an enthusiast. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using very old technology to help me navigate my otherwise very modern and digital world. Why? Because it makes me think&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s fun.
I never grew up with fountain pens. I understand that there are places in the world today that still tech kids to write with them, and that in many cases those students can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get away from these messy devices and start using something more modern like a ballpoint pen.</description>

        <description>It has been about a year since I started my analog journey. It&amp;rsquo;s has had some ups and some downs, but overall the experience has been extremely positive. I stopped bouncing back and forth between task-tracking tools and productivity systems. I tore it all down, I went back to basics, and found simplest way of doing the things that needed to be done. Most importantly I found something that I could sustain over the long haul.</description>

        <description>This is the third article in my series about exploring a more analogue existence. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested you may want to check out part 1, part 2, and part 3 before continuing.
I always thought that fountain pens were kind of neat. A quaint throwback to a simpler time where people put pen to paper when issuing an invitation to dinner, and when manners and etiquette were the order of the day.</description>

        <description>This is the third article in my series about exploring a more analogue existence. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested you may want to check out part 1 and part 2 before continuing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with a slightly (drastically?) more analogue lifestyle for the past few months. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;m becoming some kind of anti-tech zealot, just that I think I can find a bit more balance in my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about my adoption of notebooks and paper for my handwritten notes at work, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t talk much about the how.</description>

        <description>This is the second article in my series about exploring a more analogue existence. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested you may want to check out part 1 before continuing.
The second part of this tale starts a very long time ago. My relationship with notes and note-taking is one fraught with missteps, mistrust and frustration. I had always been a decent student. Mainly, I would later learn, because I had a pretty good memory &amp;ndash; particularly for things that I hear.</description>
