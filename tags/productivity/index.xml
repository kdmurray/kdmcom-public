        <description>For the last four years I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fountain pen user, some might even say an enthusiast. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using very old technology to help me navigate my otherwise very modern and digital world. Why? Because it makes me think&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s fun.
I never grew up with fountain pens. I understand that there are places in the world today that still tech kids to write with them, and that in many cases those students can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get away from these messy devices and start using something more modern like a ballpoint pen.</description>

      <title>Agile Resolutions</title>

        <description>We&amp;rsquo;re coming up to the end of the year again. I&amp;rsquo;m already starting to see the conversations starting about one of my most hated holiday season traditions: New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions.
Why am I such a grinch about self improvement? Why be opposed to people making a change for the better? I&amp;rsquo;m not, and I&amp;rsquo;m not. It&amp;rsquo;s not the change, or even the resolution itself that I have problems with, it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;New Year&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; bit, and all of the associated issues that come with it.</description>

      <title>Simple Isn&#39;t Easy</title>

        <description>Simple and easy &amp;ndash; These are two words that the English language allows people to confuse and that often become the source of misunderstandings of all sorts of sayings, advice, instructions and all manner of other communication.
What&amp;rsquo;s the difference? Easy is a measure of difficulty. If something is easy to do, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a great deal of effort and most people will be able to complete the task. The level of ease may depend on other factors, tall people can reach things more easily than short people for example, but generally speaking if something is easy the majority of people will be able to do it without much stress or difficulty.</description>
