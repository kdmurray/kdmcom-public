        <description>For the last four years I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fountain pen user, some might even say an enthusiast. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using very old technology to help me navigate my otherwise very modern and digital world. Why? Because it makes me think&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s fun.
I never grew up with fountain pens. I understand that there are places in the world today that still tech kids to write with them, and that in many cases those students can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get away from these messy devices and start using something more modern like a ballpoint pen.</description>

      <title>Agile Resolutions</title>

        <description>We&amp;rsquo;re coming up to the end of the year again. I&amp;rsquo;m already starting to see the conversations starting about one of my most hated holiday season traditions: New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions.
Why am I such a grinch about self improvement? Why be opposed to people making a change for the better? I&amp;rsquo;m not, and I&amp;rsquo;m not. It&amp;rsquo;s not the change, or even the resolution itself that I have problems with, it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;New Year&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; bit, and all of the associated issues that come with it.</description>

      <title>Simple Isn&#39;t Easy</title>
      <link>https://kdmurray.com/blog/2018/12/simple-isnt-easy/</link>

        <description>Simple and easy &amp;ndash; These are two words that the English language allows people to confuse and that often become the source of misunderstandings of all sorts of sayings, advice, instructions and all manner of other communication.
What&amp;rsquo;s the difference? Easy is a measure of difficulty. If something is easy to do, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a great deal of effort and most people will be able to complete the task. The level of ease may depend on other factors, tall people can reach things more easily than short people for example, but generally speaking if something is easy the majority of people will be able to do it without much stress or difficulty.</description>

        <description>The key to success is quite often getting started. The laws of conservation of energy apply to the macro scale of our lives as much as they do to the basic physical principles of the universe. A body at rest will remain at rest, while a body in motion will remain in motion.
For anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever tried to &amp;ldquo;get in shape&amp;rdquo; the starting of that routine is often done with sheer willpower.</description>

        <description>It has been about a year since I started my analog journey. It&amp;rsquo;s has had some ups and some downs, but overall the experience has been extremely positive. I stopped bouncing back and forth between task-tracking tools and productivity systems. I tore it all down, I went back to basics, and found simplest way of doing the things that needed to be done. Most importantly I found something that I could sustain over the long haul.</description>

      <title>Year of Done</title>
      <link>https://kdmurray.com/blog/2018/01/year-of-done/</link>

        <description>Done. It&amp;rsquo;s a word that conjures up finality. Following in the footsteps of 2017&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Year of Less&amp;rdquo; I have christened 2018 my &amp;ldquo;Year of Done&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of resolutions, be they New Year&amp;rsquo;s or otherwise. I do however like the idea of a theme for the year. After some soul-searching, add some cognitive down-time in the month of December, I have decided that &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; will be my theme for 2018.</description>

        <description>This is the third article in my series about exploring a more analogue existence. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested you may want to check out part 1, part 2, and part 3 before continuing.
I always thought that fountain pens were kind of neat. A quaint throwback to a simpler time where people put pen to paper when issuing an invitation to dinner, and when manners and etiquette were the order of the day.</description>

        <description>This is the third article in my series about exploring a more analogue existence. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested you may want to check out part 1 and part 2 before continuing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with a slightly (drastically?) more analogue lifestyle for the past few months. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;m becoming some kind of anti-tech zealot, just that I think I can find a bit more balance in my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about my adoption of notebooks and paper for my handwritten notes at work, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t talk much about the how.</description>

      <title>Analogue Journey Part 2 Re Educating</title>

        <description>This is the second article in my series about exploring a more analogue existence. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested you may want to check out part 1 before continuing.
The second part of this tale starts a very long time ago. My relationship with notes and note-taking is one fraught with missteps, mistrust and frustration. I had always been a decent student. Mainly, I would later learn, because I had a pretty good memory &amp;ndash; particularly for things that I hear.</description>

        <description>About four months ago I declared bankruptcy &amp;ndash; of a sort. It was a kind of technological bankruptcy. This is the the tale of that decision but to find its roots I need to take you back to a time before I&amp;rsquo;d come to this realization. A time when, for me, technology could solve all of my problems. This goes back years &amp;ndash; though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many at this point.</description>

        <description>I bought a ticket. The steam liner is in dry dock.
Sometimes you have a good idea. An idea that will, in the long run at least, save you time. That idea makes so much sense you can explain it to other people and they shout &amp;ldquo;Yes! I get it! You should totally build a steam liner!&amp;rdquo;
But you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.
There are ways to get across the ocean. You can buy a boat.</description>

        <description>Title: Hamlet&amp;rsquo;s Blackberry Author: William Powers
I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get this book read for about the last 18 months. It had come highly recommended by a friend who found the book to be a good look into the technological overload of our modern times, and the inherent constant connectivity to the crowds provided by the Internet.
It took me quite a while to get into this book. Powers&#39; continual assertion that the technology that we have come to rely on is disconnecting us from ourselves, and our reality.</description>
