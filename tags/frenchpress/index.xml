        <description>Over the past week or so it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty warm here on the Canadian West Coast. That&amp;rsquo;s led me to want to drink a lot more iced coffee than usual. The downside of this being, of course, that take-out coffee is way more expensive than at-home coffee. So it was time to find a home-grown solution to this problem.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started to make the majority of my home-based coffee in a french press and that&amp;rsquo;s done a fine job for me of getting my morning coffee with a minimum amount of hassle and an end product that I really enjoy, thanks in part to James Hoffman&amp;rsquo;s Ultimate French Press technique.</description>
