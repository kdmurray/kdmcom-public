        <description>It has been about a year since I started my analog journey. It&amp;rsquo;s has had some ups and some downs, but overall the experience has been extremely positive. I stopped bouncing back and forth between task-tracking tools and productivity systems. I tore it all down, I went back to basics, and found simplest way of doing the things that needed to be done. Most importantly I found something that I could sustain over the long haul.</description>

        <description>About four months ago I declared bankruptcy &amp;ndash; of a sort. It was a kind of technological bankruptcy. This is the the tale of that decision but to find its roots I need to take you back to a time before I&amp;rsquo;d come to this realization. A time when, for me, technology could solve all of my problems. This goes back years &amp;ndash; though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many at this point.</description>
