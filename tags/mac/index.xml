        <description>About four months ago I declared bankruptcy &amp;ndash; of a sort. It was a kind of technological bankruptcy. This is the the tale of that decision but to find its roots I need to take you back to a time before I&amp;rsquo;d come to this realization.

        <description>In a recent conversation with Knightwise we were musing that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that it&amp;rsquo;s very long since we were both ragging on Dave to get off Windows and get a Mac. Today we&amp;rsquo;re both seriously entertaining the possibility that our next primary computing device might be running an OS from Redmond. What changed? Has Windows gotten that much better?
